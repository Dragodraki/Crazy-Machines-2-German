I am not the owner of the game files. All rights belong to Faktum Software, Viva Media and Steam.
These files won't work alone. You have to buy the full game from Steam first.
This patch is done to make people happy who try to play the game in German again. Steams version is not able to do so for years now.
Don't abuse these files for anything else, like cracking or hacking. I accept no responsibility for any damage.
